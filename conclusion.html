    <h1>Conclusion of Champion Data Analyis</h1>
    <div class="description">
        By looking through the data, particularly at various metrics such as number of wins, margin of victory, and player performance distribuition, 
        one can get an idea of which nations end up performing the best at these tournments more often than not. 
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        When just looking at number of wins, India and South Africa come out as a distant best. Winning a high amount of games is an indication of consistent success
        at the highest level, and could be a good measure or description of dominance.
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        Looking at the margin of wins however gives different perspective. Margin of runs specifically seems to be a better indicator as most teams have a similar average margin of wickets victories.
        In this metric, the West Indies (a collection of 10 soverign nations playing under a united banner) and Afghanistan dominate while South Africa and India are on the lower end of things.
        To not just win consistently but to also win comfortably and decisively is important when looking at a dominant international team.
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        Finally, a look into Player of the Match award win distribuition can give a clue as to the manner in which the international nations achieve their success. Teams such as India or Bangladesh show uneven distribuition and a reliance on their best player 
        to provide the wins for the team. On the other hand, South Africa or New Zealand have a more even distribuition and  higher count of different players with player 
        of the match awards, indicating that there is no single player that is significantly better or heavily depended on. Whether having a handful of highly talented game winners or an overall competitive team makes a nation 
        dominant is one up to subjective opinion, but it shows the different approaches to success from the different nations.

    <h1>Who is the Ultimate Champion of Cricket?</h1>
    <div class="description">
        Cricket is an age-old sport that evolved in England and spread across its colonies. Eventually, those under the British rule took their colonizer's game and made it a challenge to try and best the colonizers themselves. The eclectic and wide reach of the sport eventually demanded a world championship to truly decide the ultimate champions. This analysis tries to answer the question: Can one country be specifically called the champion of all champions? Is there a nation that has been consistently more successful and dominant in the new age of the sport?
